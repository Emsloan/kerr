# Kerr Black Hole Orbit Simulator

This simple browser-based simulation visualizes an object orbiting a rotating black hole.
It allows adjustment of:

- **Black hole mass** and **spin**
- **Orbit radius** of the orbiting body
- **Density** of the orbiting body

The page shows whether the object is inside or outside the Roche limit based on the
selected parameters. The Roche limit now decreases with black hole spin to approximate
the effect of spacetime waves for a prograde orbit.

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to try it out. The orbit radius slider
now reaches up to 1e10Â m and the canvas displays both the Roche limit (red
dashed circle) and the orbital path, automatically scaling the view so the
features remain visible.
