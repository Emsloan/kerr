# Kerr Black Hole Orbit Simulator

This simple browser-based simulation visualizes an object orbiting a rotating black hole.
It allows adjustment of:

- **Black hole mass** and **spin**
- **Orbit radius** of the orbiting body
- **Density** of the orbiting body

The page shows whether the object is inside or outside the Roche limit based on the
selected parameters.

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to try it out.
